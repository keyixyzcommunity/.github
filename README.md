# 🉑KEYI🉑

This KEYI🉑 project began as a social memecoin experiment at a solana gambling party in Toronto, and quickly became a global community.

Join us and say to your dreams "KEYI!🉑" which means YES! We can help make dreams into realities when we work together.

Well, we're still only a few days old. Please be patient and kind. 

Pump.fun was the tool at hand for launching, using cropped screenshots of emojis and SOL that was begged for off the street. The kind soul that blessed us with the 0.1sol we needed to mint the contract, has asked to remain anonymous. Bless! Even from the very first moments, KEYI🉑 has been about friendship and giving and community. Degens want something to care about, and they want it to be okay to care about each other. We say "KEYI🉑!" and KEYI🉑 means "YES!"

Now is a good time to note that this is not a financial instrument or investment, it's a community of people who want good things and do good things. Join us! When you take actions, take responsibility for yourself.
YOLO Yeet your tokens and join the enlightenment. 

If you have to sell to feed your family, do it. If you're just gambling and you'd sell anything to anyone if you made a penny, maybe it's time to think about why? Pretend it has all gone to zero, and take a REAL gamble - the gamble that you can be part of a better world, a better life. The real riches of this world are not measured in numbers, my friends.
